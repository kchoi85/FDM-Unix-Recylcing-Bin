# Safe_rm Unix Recycling Bin Project
### 05-16-2020

**Problem**: UNIX has no recycle bin.  When you remove a file or directory, it is gone and cannot be restored. This project is to write a safe_rm and safe_rm_restore to provide users with a recycle bin which can be used to safely delete and restore files.
